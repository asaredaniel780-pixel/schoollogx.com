GCTU History
Ghana Communication Technology University (GCTU) was originally known as Ghana Telecom University which emerged from the separation of Ghana Telecom Company and the University. It was formerly known as Ghana Telecom Training Centre (GTTC). GTTC was established in 1948 by the Post and Telecommunications Department as a telecommunications training school by the then British Administration. The purpose for the establishment of the training centre was to train technicians and linesmen to operate and maintain telecommunication equipment and plants. The first batch of 21 technical assistant trainees with school leaving certificate background was admitted to undergo a three year course of training in telephony.</p>

GTTC, being the only school of its kind in the country and the sub region at that time, catered for the needs of other establishments such as the military, civil aviation, the maritime industry, meteorological services and the police. It also catered for the needs of neighboring British West African countries.</p>

The first modernization programme for the institution took place in 1968 when the service of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) was engaged to train instructors of the centre in Course Development and Instructional Technology. At the same time, the first Electro-Mechanical Switch and the Microwave Training Unit of Philips NV of the Netherlands were installed for training purposes.</p>

In 1974, the Training Centre expanded its training coverage to include institutions/agencies such as the Civil Aviation, the Army, Police and the Meteorological Services. In 1989, the institution again engaged the services of the ITU under an IDA loan agreement to upgrade both its facilities as well as improve on the human resource capabilities of staff. This was geared towards sustaining international standards in training methodology. Under the programme, new training methods such as computer- based training (CBT) and CODEVTEL course development methodologies were introduced.</p>

Multi-disciplinary training programmes covering disciplines such as Management, Finance, Marketing and Information Technology were introduced to meet the needs of staff of the then telecom business. Over time, GTTC expanded its courses to include Air-Condition, Energy System and Multimedia Studies. Short courses were also introduced over time. The training structure incorporated classroom instructions with the expectation that in the distant future, virtual classroom programmes through the use of the internet will be introduced. GTTC also became the centre for the organization of all Commonwealth Telecommunications Organization (CTO) courses in Ghana.</p>

In July 1998, GT in collaboration with the Multimedia University (MMU) of Malaysia, introduced the Diploma Programme in Telecommunications Engineering (DTE) to meet its needs for skilled hands, as well as that of the national telecom industry. The programme run for four (4) years and ended in August 2003.</p>

In 2002, Ghana Telecom signed a management contract with Telenor of Norway. The new management upgraded the infrastructure and equipment at GTTC in anticipation of upgrading the institution to a university. The Centre was named Ghana Telecom University College (GTUC) and obtained institutional accreditation in March 2005. It was inaugurated on August 15, 2006.
